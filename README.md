# Pirate Rebalance  
Pirate Rebalance is a mod for [Starsector by Fractal Softworks](https://fractalsoftworks.com/) that seeks to overhaul the behaviour of the pirate AI to open up the range of playstyles compatible with colonization.

In its vanilla state, Starsector does a great job in providing many ways to play the game. Want to build a vast military fleet and conquer your way across the sector? You can do that! Want to live out your fantasies running contraband between worlds as a lowly smuggler? You can do that too! Unfortunately, this starts to break down somewhat if the player decides to colonize (at least as of version 0.9.1a). Hyper-aggressive pirates attack every new colony with numbers that quickly get out of hand for players without a whole lot of firepower. This may be fine for the adventurer seeking to carve out an empire, but it takes the concept of building a backwater world hidden away from the sector core out of the cards entirely, just as one example.

Pirate Rebalance makes several adjustments to the base pirate AI that should allow for more variety in how they interact with the player (and factions) and vice-versa. See the Features section below for more info on the individual changes.

## Installation  
  
1. Extract contents of zip into the mods folder in your Starsector install directory  
2. Toggle Pirate Rebalance on in the mods panel on the Starsector launcher  
  
## Usage  
  
Featureset customization coming in a future release.
~~You can customize which behaviour Pirate Rebalance overrides by changing values in `pr_config.json`. See the features section below for details of each behaviour change.~~  
  
As Pirate Rebalance overrides several core behaviours, and has therefore been marked as a "total conversion" mod for stability reasons. By default, only utility mods (like [LazyWizard's Console Commands](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=4106.0)) will be loaded alongside it. If you want to use this mod with other, non-utility mods, open `mod_info.json` and set the following:

`"totalConversion": false`  

Be aware that this may cause crashes, or prevent the game from running entirely if used with incompatible mods.
